<p>Ariton is different than your average app. <strong>You don't need to register to sign up</strong>, 
  Ariton has already made a new account for you.</p>

  <p>
    If you want to keep your account, you can <strong>take a backup</strong> of it. This will allow you to use your account on other devices, 
    and if you delete your browser data, you can restore it.
  </p>
  
  <p>We also suggest you start protecting your account by <strong>securing it with your personal password</strong>. Right now anyone who have access 
    to your device, can access your Ariton account.
